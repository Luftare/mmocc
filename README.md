## The together app

Alpha spec:

* Has a "Start" button that starts a timer from 100 minutes to zero
* Displays the remaining time as minutes and seconds
* Displays the percentage of fullness for each 12 0.33 litre bottles, initially 100%
* Every minute 1/100 part (approximately the amount of one shot glass) of the total fullness of the bottles will be reduced. E.g. after 50 minutes, half of the bottles will have 100%, half will have 0%
* After start button has been pressed and the timer has started, the start button text changes to "Give Up" and pressing the button will stop the timer and set the timer to 100 minutes, also bottles will fill to 100%
* When the timer reaches 0, a text "Congratulations, you have chugged 100 beers. You are now drunk." will appear.
